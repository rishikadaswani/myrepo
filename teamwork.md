#Teamwork Contract

## Milestone 1 

**Division of Labour** 
*Linger* - working on the README.md file 
*Rishika* - working on the teamwork.md file and writing the teamwork contract 
*Eashan* - working on the Troubleshooting.Rmd file

We will work collaboratively on the merge and pull request. There will have to be one pull request per teammate however, we will support each other should any of us have difficulty with this. 

**Timing** 
Ideally, submissions should happen two/three days after we have our meeting. Our timeline currently, is that the above files should be created and have some content by September, 18th which is when we have our next meeting.  

**Communication** 
Our main platform for communication will be our Slack channel. We will also be meeting via zoom and in person. Dates and times will be fixed on Slack.
